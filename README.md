Design system for SoundMolto products.

Very WIP, lots of things need to be implemented.

## Requirements
- Accessible by default (provide support for disabling animations, controls for increasing word spacing etc)
- Small (Components should never exceed 10kb)
- Fast (Threaded if they are heavy)
- Bleeding edge now, stable by the time it's finished.
- Easy to onboard developers

## TODO
(everything)
- Sidebar
- Appbar
- Card
- Panel
- Input
- Button
- Form
- WebAudio (w/ a dash of sugar)
- Waveform (interactable waveform)
- Scrub (a trackbar that you can "scrub" through to set the current time in a track)
- Scrollable List (eg/ React Window)
    - Filterable List
    - Sortable List
- Charts
- Modal
- Avatar
- Image (w/ basic things like lazy loading etc)
- Floating panel
- Sliding Panel
- Timeline
- Badge
- Bubble text (text component that has a background w/ curved borders to make it kinda bubbled)
